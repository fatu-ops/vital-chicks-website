          <p>
            The business began in 1991 under Namdar (Pvt.) Limited, with direct involvement in broiler and breeder farming alongside
            in-house feed production. Working at farm level shaped our understanding early on: feed quality only matters if it delivers
            results on the ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our early years continue to influence how we approach feed manufacturing today.

          <p>
            In 2003, feed operations were formalised under the name Vital Chicks &amp; Feeds, with a clear focus on manufacturing dependable
            animal feed for commercial use. As demand grew, so did our product range, expanding beyond poultry to include cattle, fish,
            and other livestock feeds.
          </p>
          <p>
            This period laid the groundwork for structured production and long-term supplier relationships.

          <p>
            By 2015, the company entered a phase of operational maturity. Feed compositions were refined to improve feed efficiency,
            support animal health, and deliver predictable results across different production cycles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Greater emphasis was placed on quality control, consistency, and adjusting feed to suit local climate and farming conditions.
